# MIPS-Processor
CS220 Project, IIT Kanpur

Note that, all instructions should use standard MIPS byte based addressing.
Internally, for storage in memory and registers, we use byte based addressing, wherever an address is stored.
However, in actual implementation of pc, data_memory, instruction_memory , we use word based addressing.
